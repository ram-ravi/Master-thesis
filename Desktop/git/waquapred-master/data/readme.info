SMHI: raw data from SMHI
GKV: raw data from GKV
 -----> these two can be found in the box folder

allFiles:
	- one file per datatype and location
	- removed missing data/dates without measurement


cleanedFiles:
	- round times to closest full hour (hour is the highest resolution we currently have)
		-> undone because some measurements for e.coli would have been rounded to the same hour
	- transform everything (from GKV mainly) to numerical values except colifast measurements
