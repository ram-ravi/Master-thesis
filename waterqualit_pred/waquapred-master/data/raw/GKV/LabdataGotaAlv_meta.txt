Lab Data Gota Alv

File contains laboratory data:

- all faecal indicators regularly monitored
- physical/chemical analyses that may have a predictive value and with a high enough (?) sampling frequency
- conductivity (=sampling seawater, not river water)

Data Cleansing performed:
- Turbidity: 	analysed different date-time at two different labs	merged to one variable (=same method)
- Conductivity:	analysed different date-time at two different labs	merged to one variable (=same method)
- Enterococci:	two different methods with different recoveries		variables kept separate
- Colour:	two different methods with different methodology	variables kept separate (=same unit, so possible to merge though)

- Variables often more than 1 sample at unique date-time		results merged for each “location and unique sampling date-time”, NO data has been aggregated
									(sampleID and cause of sampling excluded due to mergeing)

- Characters “-” ie no numeric result					deleted (except for temperature), convert to NA
- Characters < “less than” and > “more than”				kept (ie conversion not agreed)
- Empty cells								convert to NA
- Data quality								checked all data graphically after cleansing
